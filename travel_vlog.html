After seven hours long journey, we reached Sylhet. <br> We visited all the places of tourist attractions like-

    <h4>This was my Kuakata Sea Beach Tour picture.</h4>
    <p>Kuakata, known as the "Daughter of the Sea," is a unique coastal destination in Bangladesh, <br> renowned for its panoramic sea beach and the rare ability to witness both sunrise and sunset over the Bay of Bengal from the same vantage point. <br> It's a place of natural beauty, cultural significance, and historical importance, attracting both tourists and pilgrims. <br> Kuakata's beach stretches for 18 kilometers, offering a wide expanse of sand where one can enjoy the full spectacle of the sun's daily journey. <br> The name "Kuakata" itself is derived from the Bengali words "kua" (well) and "kata" (dug), reflecting the history of the Rakhine community who settled there and dug wells for fresh water. <br> This community, originally from Myanmar, sought refuge in Kuakata after being displaced. 
Beyond its natural allure, <br> Kuakata holds cultural and historical significance, particularly for Hindu and Buddhist communities. It's a place of pilgrimage, especially during the festivals of Rush Purnima and Maghi Purnima, <br> where devotees gather to take holy baths in the bay and participate in traditional fairs. A 100-year-old Buddhist temple and two ancient wells further add to the area's rich heritage. <br>
Kuakata offers a blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and recreational opportunities, making it a popular destination for travelers seeking a unique experience in Bangladesh. <br> I visited some place in Kuakata which was <br>

    <h4>This was my Bagerhat 60 Dome Mosque Tour picture.</h4>
<p>The Sixty Dome Mosque, also known as Shait Gambuj Masjid, is a historical mosque located in Bagerhat, Bangladesh. <br> Built during the Bengal Sultanate period by Ulugh Khan Jahan, it is the largest mosque from that era in Bangladesh. <br> Despite its name, the mosque features 77 domes on its roof and four more on corner towers, <br> totaling 81 domes. It's a significant part of the Mosque City of Bagerhat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
